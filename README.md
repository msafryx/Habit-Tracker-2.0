# Habit Tracker 2.0

Interactive, front-end-only habit tracker inspired by the shared design. Everything runs in the browser—no backend required—so you can log habits, view weekly/monthly progress, and celebrate streak milestones right away.

## Features
- **Daily logging:** Check off 10 core habits per day and add quick notes.
- **Progress bars:** See completion percentages for each day, the current week, and the full month.
- **Week overview:** Inline habit checkboxes with per-day progress, status pills, and notes.
- **Monthly overview:** Daily cards plus weekly rollups to spot patterns at a glance.
- **Streak milestones:** Automatic badges for perfect-day streaks (5–100 days).
- **Notes & reflections:** Save longer-form notes alongside your daily logs.
- **Demo data:** Pre-seeded sample data so the UI feels alive immediately, with the option to reset.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the tracker (no build step needed).
2. Click **Mark today as perfect** or toggle individual habit checkboxes to log progress.
3. Use **Reset demo data** to restore the starter dataset.

All data is saved in `localStorage` under the `habit-tracker-2.0` key, so your edits persist between sessions in the same browser.
